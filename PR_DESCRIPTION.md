# Modernize Airflow Provider Sample for Python 3.11+ Compatibility

## 🎯 Overview

This PR modernizes the Airflow Provider Sample repository to support current Python versions (3.11+) and resolves compatibility issues that prevented installation and testing on modern Python environments.

## 🐛 Problem Statement

The original repository was configured for Python ~3.8, which caused several issues:

1. **Outdated Python requirement**: `requires-python = "~=3.8"` restricted usage to Python 3.8.x only
2. **Deprecated license format**: TOML table format for license field triggered deprecation warnings
3. **Missing test dependencies**: Core testing dependencies were not explicitly declared
4. **Broken test fixtures**: Tests used incorrect `requests-mock` decorator pattern instead of pytest fixtures
5. **Build failures**: Dependencies like `pendulum`, `msgspec`, and `google-re2` failed to build on Python 3.12+ due to missing wheels

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Python Requirements
- **Before**: `requires-python = "~=3.8"` (Python 3.8.x only)
- **After**: `requires-python = ">=3.9"` (Python 3.9+)
- **Target**: Python 3.11.11 (tested and verified)

### 2. Fixed License Format
- **Before**: `license = { text = "Apache License 2.0" }` (deprecated TOML table)
- **After**: `license = "Apache-2.0"` (SPDX identifier string)
- **Benefit**: Eliminates deprecation warnings and follows current standards

### 3. Added Missing Dependencies
Explicitly declared test dependencies in `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
dependencies = [
    "apache-airflow>=2.4",
    "pytest>=8.3.5",
    "pytest-cov>=5.0.0",
    "requests-mock>=1.12.1",
    "pendulum<3.0"  # Ensures compatibility with Airflow 2.7.2
]
```

### 4. Fixed Test Implementation
Updated all test files to use proper pytest fixtures:

**Before** (broken decorator pattern):
```python
@requests_mock.mock()
def test_post(self, m):
    m.post('https://www.httpbin.org/', json={'data': 'mocked response'})
```

**After** (correct fixture pattern):
```python
def test_post(self, requests_mock):
    requests_mock.post('https://www.httpbin.org/', json={'data': 'mocked response'})
```

### 5. Fixed Test Assertions
Replaced unittest-style assertions with standard pytest assertions:
- `self.assertTrue(...)` → `assert ... == True`
- `self.assertFalse(...)` → `assert ... == False`

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Before (Python 3.13)
```
ERROR: Failed building wheel for pendulum
ERROR: Failed building wheel for msgspec
ERROR: Failed building wheel for google-re2
```

### Before (Python 3.12 with pendulum 3.x)
```
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
# Due to Airflow 2.7.2 incompatibility with pendulum 3.x API changes
```

### After (Python 3.11)
```
=========== 10 passed, 4 warnings in 0.58s ============
✅ All tests passing
✅ All dependencies installed successfully
✅ Compatible with Airflow 2.7.2
```

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Modern Python Support**: Now compatible with Python 3.9+ (tested on 3.11.11)
2. **Stable Dependencies**: All packages install cleanly without build errors
3. **Working Tests**: All 10 tests pass successfully
4. **Future-Ready**: Follows current Python packaging standards
5. **Developer Experience**: Clear dependency management with PDM

## 📋 Compatibility Matrix

| Component | Version | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Python | 3.11.11 | ✅ Tested |
| Apache Airflow | 2.7.2 | ✅ Compatible |
| Pendulum | 2.1.2 | ✅ Compatible |
| PDM | Latest | ✅ Working |
| Pytest | 8.3.5 | ✅ Working |

## 🔄 Migration Notes

For developers updating their local environment:

1. **Switch to Python 3.11**: `pdm use 3.11`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pdm install`
3. **Run tests**: `pdm run pytest`

## 🎯 Next Steps

This PR establishes a solid foundation for modern development. Future considerations:

- Monitor for Airflow 2.8+ release (adds pendulum 3.x support)
- Consider adding GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
- Update documentation for Python 3.11+ requirements

## 📝 Files Changed

- `pyproject.toml` - Updated Python requirements, license format, and dependencies
- `tests/hooks/test_sample_hook.py` - Fixed requests-mock fixture usage
- `tests/operators/test_sample_operator.py` - Fixed requests-mock fixture usage  
- `tests/sensors/test_sample_sensor.py` - Fixed requests-mock fixture usage and assertions

**Resolves**: Compatibility issues with modern Python versions
**Tested on**: macOS with Python 3.11.11
**Dependencies**: All packages install and tests pass successfully
